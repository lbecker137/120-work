# Mark down of week 6

## This homework cycle
This was a much tougher week than previous. I spent a lot longer on the homework.
There was definitely a fair bit of frustration on my end. Mostly involving the map
function. a lot of this isn't what I'm used to as well, so I'm adapting to the new structure.

## Problems
I spent so long trying to figure out the map function. I was essentially trying to
do the exact same thing that was shown to us in the video, but it was just not working.
Eventually I tried using a different shape and it worked. The difference between the 2
was the opacity levels, so I just asked about it in the issues section. This, of course, was also the piece I procrastinated on
, so I was doubly frustrated. Other than that, the week went relatively well. In the future, I'll be more proactive in asking for help. Overall, other than that issue, there was a good amount of debugging all around, but most of it was random syntax errors.

## triumphs
When that map function finally worked. That felt like my biggest triumph. Also the tree art. It wasn't all that difficult, but it worked on the first or second try. It was exactly what I planned it to be as well, so that felt like a very early victory.
