# Mark down of week 6

## This homework cycle
This was a much tougher week than previous. I spent a lot longer on the homework.
There was definitely a fair bit of frustration on my end. Mostly involving the map
function. a lot of this isn't what I'm used to as well, so I'm adapting to the new structure. 

## Problems
I spent so long trying to figure out the map function. I was essentially trying to
do the exact same thing that was shown to us in the video, but it was just not working.
Eventually I tried using a different shape and it worked. The difference between the 2
was the opacity levels, so I just asked about it in the issues section. This, of course, was also the piece I procrastinated on
, so I was doubly frustrated. Other than that, the week went relatively well. There was a good amount of debugging all around, but most of it was random syntax errors.
