# HW 12 | Interacting objects
## The homework week
I spent quite a bit of time on code this week. More than I usually do. I went through the material fairly fast and kept up with the issues on github. although, I didn't have much advice for anyone this week and didn't have any major issues to post myself. My code had been a pet project for a while now, but each week I was given more information to help me along. I designed a really simple game of breakout. 
## My code
As I said earlier, this had been a pet project of mine for a few weeks. I never put too much time into it, but I added something small every week for the last 3 weeks. I had never gotten it to work properly though, so I had to spend a lot of time debugging and polishing. Before this week, I had a brick, paddle, and ball class set up for the code and a frame of how I wanted it to work. I figured if I used a for loop to make a certain amount of bricks and put them in an array, I could simply splice one out of the array when it was hit by the ball. Seeing this week's material put that exact concept right in front of me and I was thrilled because I had been thinking about it for weeks! Overall, the code actually didn't give me too much issue. I used a lot of the existing code I had and debugged most of it relatively quickly. I had one small error that had me caught for a quite while, but after taking a break from coding for a bit, it was easy to see and fix. I'm so glad it actually worked out fine this week. I was concerned I wouldn't get to finish it for the semester, but rather have to finish it as a personal project. I will probably make it into a better game myself later by adding more rows of bricks and creating a loss counter, but I didn't feel like I had the time to do so before turning it in.
