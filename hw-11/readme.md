# HW 11 | Object Orientation 
## The homework week
Object oriented coding was one of my favorite aspects to learn about in coding. This week was tough as I once again had family in town. I've been wondering how in depth we would go into object orientation before we started this week. I'm very glad I have some background in coding because it took me a long time to grasp what exactly object orientation was the first time I learned of it. This time around, I feel comfortable with what it is and why it's used. I just had to learn the syntax for it in Javascript. Unfortunately I made a huge mistake this week and wrote down the wrong due date, so I'm turning this in a few hours late.
## My code
I spent a lot of time this week messing around with object orientation to get a feel for it, but my code is very simple. Honestly, I just find it pleasing to watch things move across the screen. This is why many of my codes have had some aspect of that in them. This one is very simple with bricks moving across the screen at different speeds. I was considering maybe coding breakout with object orientation, so I started that code and have been messing around with it, but I couldn't finish it in time to use it for this week's homework.
