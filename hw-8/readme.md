# HW 7 | Loops
## The homework week

On to loops! I was very happy to move into this week both for the lighter homework load and for the opportunity to read up on loops in code! I didn't do much outside of the reading for the week although I did watch a few extra videos on loops. I ended up only using while loops in this weeks code, but I've used for loops in previous week's assignments.

## My code

I remembered an assignment from the first coding class I took. It was to cover the canvas in circles. I never finished it back then. For some reason I could only figure out how to create one line of circles. I decided to try that again. I found it much easier this time around. Nested while loops was the obvious solution to the problem. I did stumble on getting the second line for a minute before I realized that I had to reset the x value of the circle to it's original point. I then wanted to add an aesthetic element. At first I was going to have a black circle cover the white background, but I experimented with colors and found my end product to be more visually interesting.
