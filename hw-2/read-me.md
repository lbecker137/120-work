# Markup for Week Two

1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle
This week I worked through the material

provided on the course website. I

unfortunately started on Monday, but

spent the last three days applying

myself to the material. 

 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
 * As, stated in the previous answer I worked through the material provided
 * I spent time using Git through Powershell and the Github desktop app
 * I worked through any issues I ran into, although they were few and fairly simple

 3. The only problem I ran into was when I started practicing the Git commands in powershell. I noticed that when I made changes to my Test file, Git wasn't tracking them. The issue ended up being that when I was saving the file, atom was saving a new version of it on my desktop rather than in my 120 file where I had moved it. I solved this just by changing the destination it was saving to. It was a simple mistake. I did not help anyone this week on Github because I frankly didn't know the answer to most of the questions.
