# HW 9 | functions
## The homework week
I had family in town this week which game me less time to work through the material, but I made my way through it. The toughest part of the week for me was just coming up with an idea for the code. Inspiration was not my friend. I had fun making what I did, but I'm still not entirely happy with it. Arrays are definitely fun to work with. I actually looked up the documentation for them a few weeks ago as I've been experimenting on my own with p5.js and was excited when last weeks material covered them. Functions are something that have always just come hand in hand with any coding class I've taken. I will admit, the draw loop leaves me off-kilter. It's so different than anything I've experienced before that it's harder for me to visualize where I need to be in a code. I've always had a very methodical way of breaking down problems and it's hard for me to incorporate the draw loop into that.  
## My code

I just made caterpillars that move across the screen and changed the mouse cursor. The worst issue I had coding wise was a syntax error. I kept using commas in my for loop rather than semicolons. I also did have an issue with the loop getting overloaded or something. When there was a certain amount of caterpillars on the screen, the animation would freeze. I fixed this by randomly removing numbers from the array, but I'm not sure why the error occurred in the first place.
